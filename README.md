[![Releases](https://img.shields.io/badge/Releases-Download%20Latest%20Version-blue)](https://github.com/NuuJK/gorilix/releases)

## Overview

Gorilix is a lightweight, fault-tolerant actor model framework designed for Go. It draws inspiration from Erlang/OTP, providing a robust platform for building scalable and resilient distributed systems. With Gorilix, developers can create concurrent applications that handle errors gracefully, making it an ideal choice for modern software solutions.

## Features

- **Actor Model**: Leverage the actor model to manage state and behavior in a concurrent environment.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Built-in mechanisms to recover from failures without crashing the entire system.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale your applications to handle increased load.
- **Concurrency**: Simplify concurrent programming with a clear and effective model.
- **Ecosystem Compatibility**: Works well with existing Go libraries and tools.
